# Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to the Project: First Steps for New Device Setup

This guide will help you set up your environment and get started with this repository. Follow these steps carefully to ensure your device is ready for analysis and collaboration.

---

### 1. Install Required Software

- **R** (latest version recommended)
- **RStudio** (optional, but recommended)
- **Quarto CLI** ([Download here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/))
- **Git** (for version control)

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run: 

```sh
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd books-of-ukraine
```
### Or download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to your desired location. **(recomended for beginners)**
---

### 3. Install Required R Packages

Open R or RStudio and run:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "dplyr", "readr", "DBI", "RSQLite", "quarto", "stringr", "yaml", "knitr", "rmarkdown"
))
```

---

### 4. Data Access

This repository includes pre-processed data files, so no external authentication is required. The analysis-ready databases are available in `data-private/derived/`.

**Local VS Code settings:** Copy the example settings file to create your local workspace settings (this file is ignored by git):

```powershell
copy .vscode\settings.json.example .vscode\settings.json
```

### 5. Verify Setup

Test your environment setup:

```r
# Check if required packages are installed
source("scripts/check-setup.R")

# Test database connection
source("scripts/test-database-connection.R")
```

**Also ensure the following directories exist:** `manipulation`, `analysis`, `scripts`, `ai`, `data-private`, `data-public` (these should be present if you cloned the repo).

---

### 6. Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Investigate publishing trends in Ukraine since 2005, with a focus on regional differences and the use of Russian language in books.
- **Structure:** Modular scripts, reproducible reports, and robust context/memory management for collaborative analysis.
- **Documentation:** See `README.md`, `guides/command-reference.md`, and `guides/` for detailed guides.

## ðŸš¦ First Commands to Run

Open R or RStudio, set your working directory to the project root, and run these commands in order:

```r
# 1. Comprehensive environment and workflow check
comprehensive_project_diagnostics() # Checks your R environment, required packages, project structure, and reports any missing dependencies or setup issues. Does NOT install packages automatically.

# 2. Analyze overall project status
analyze_project_status() # Summarizes project health, recent changes, and provides recommendations for next steps in your workflow.

# 3. Check flow.R status
check_flow_status() # Validates the flow.R pipeline, checks for missing or outdated steps, and reports on the status of data and report generation.

# 4. Check current AI context
context_refresh() # Scans and summarizes the current AI/project memory context, showing which components are loaded and available for analysis.
```

These commands will:
- Validate your environment and dependencies
- Check for required files and data
- Assess project health and readiness
- Guide you to the next steps
