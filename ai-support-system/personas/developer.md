## PowerShell Scripting Standards

**CRITICAL RULE: NO UNICODE/EMOJI IN .ps1 FILES**

**Prohibited Characters**
- ‚ùå **NO emojis**: `üöÄ`, `‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üìä`, `üîß`, etc.
- ‚ùå **NO Unicode symbols**: `‚Ä¢`, `‚Üí`, `‚ü∂`, special bullets, arrows
- ‚ùå **NO combining characters**: Characters with diacritical marks that may not encode properly

**Required Standards**
- ‚úÖ **ASCII-only content**: Use plain English text and standard punctuation
- ‚úÖ **UTF-8 encoding**: Ensure file is saved as UTF-8 without BOM
- ‚úÖ **Test before deployment**: Always test `.ps1` files with `powershell -File "script.ps1"` before adding to tasks

### Repository-wide script standard
- ‚úÖ **ASCII-only for scripts**: This project prefers ASCII-only content for automation and reporting scripts. In addition to the strict `.ps1` rule above, maintainers should avoid emojis and special Unicode characters in `.R`, `.Rmd`, and `.qmd` files to prevent rendering and encoding issues during report generation and automated tasks.

### **Safe Alternatives**
```powershell
# ‚ùå WRONG (causes parsing errors):
Write-Host "üöÄ Starting pipeline..." -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "‚úÖ Stage completed!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "‚ùå Error occurred" -ForegroundColor Red

# ‚úÖ CORRECT (works reliably):
Write-Host "Starting pipeline..." -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Stage completed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Error occurred" -ForegroundColor Red
```

### **Why This Matters**
Unicode/emoji characters in PowerShell scripts cause:
- **Parsing errors**: "TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString" 
- **Encoding corruption**: `üöÄ` becomes `√∞≈∏≈°‚Ç¨` (unreadable)
- **Task failures**: VS Code tasks fail with Exit Code: 1
- **Cross-platform issues**: Different systems handle Unicode differently

### **Testing Protocol**
Before committing any `.ps1` file:
1. Test with: `powershell -File "path/to/script.ps1"`
2. Verify Exit Code: 0 (success)
3. Check output for garbled characters
4. Test through VS Code tasks if applicable

This prevents pipeline failures and ensures reliable automation across the project.

### **File Organization Standards**
- **Workflow PowerShell scripts**: Place in `./scripts/ps1/` directory
- **Setup/Bootstrapping scripts**: Keep in project root for discoverability
- **All `.ps1` files**: Must follow ASCII-only standards regardless of location
