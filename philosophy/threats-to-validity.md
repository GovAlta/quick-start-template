# Threats to Validity"

# Overview

To use the results of a data analysis as evidence in support of our views and decisions, we must address various **threats to validity** of conclusions drawn from the data.

**Threats to validity** refer to factors or issues that can compromise the accuracy, credibility, or generalizability of research findings. These threats can introduce biases or errors into the research process, leading to flawed conclusions or limited applicability of the results.

[Shadish, Cook, and Campbell (2002)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-17373-000) distinguish four broad categories, each of which can be further divided into specific threats, which we invite you to review with the following prompt:

# Threats to Validity

[Shadish, Cook, and Campbell (2002)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-17373-000) describe four broad categories of validity threats:

1.  **Statistical Conclusion Validity**: This refers to the degree to which conclusions about the relationship among variables based on the data are correct or 'reasonable'.

    Example: The study found a correlation between coffee consumption and life span, but it did not account for the fact that many of the participants were smokers, a serious confounding variable.

2.  **Internal Validity**: This pertains to the legitimacy of inferences about cause and effect.

    Example: A study found that students who studied more had better grades. However, the study failed to account for the students' prior knowledge, which could also have influenced their grades.

3.  **Construct Validity**: This type of validity concerns whether the operational definitions of the variables actually reflect the reality of the concepts being studied.

    Example: A study is conducted on happiness in the workplace, and happiness is measured only by the number of smiles. This measurement might not accurately represent the complexity of happiness.

4.  **External Validity**: This is about the degree to which findings can be generalized to other settings or groups.

    Example: A study finds that a new teaching method works well in a private school with small class sizes, but the method might not be as effective in a public school with larger classes.

# **Statistical Conclusion**

Threats to the validity of statistical conclusions include:

1.  *Low Statistical Power*: Failure to reject the null hypothesis when it should be rejected. For instance, a study might not detect a meaningful effect due to having too few participants.

2.  *Violated Assumptions of Statistical Tests*: Using parametric tests when data don't meet these tests' assumptions, like normal distribution.

# **Internal**

Threats to internal validity include:

1.  *History:* The specific events occurring between the first and second measurements in addition to the experimental variables. For example, a disaster event happening during the study period can influence the results.

2.  *Maturation*: Processes within the participants operating as a function of the passage of time. For instance, children getting naturally smarter over the course of a school year.

3.  *Testing*: The effects of taking a test upon the scores of a second testing. For instance, participants getting better on a test due to their familiarity from the first test.

# **Construct**

Threats to construct validity include:

1.  *Inadequate Definition of the Construct*: Not properly defining or operationalizing a construct. For instance, measuring intelligence solely through an IQ test.

2.  *Mono-Operation Bias*: Relying on a single method or measure. For instance, assessing depression only through self-report rather than using multiple measures.

# **External**

Threats to external validity include:

1.  *Interaction of Selection and Treatment*: Effect found only exists in the study sample, not in other populations. For example, a health intervention only works for a specific age group.

2.  *Interaction of Setting and Treatment*: The effect is not generalizable to other settings or environments. For instance, a therapy technique works only in clinical settings.

# Since 2002

Since 2002 researchers and analysts expanded on these, proposing new threats to validity that reflected and addressed concerns in the emerging environment of big data and cheap computing. To list a few examples:

# Data-Related Threats

1.  *Data Quality*: With the rise of big data, the quality of data can be a significant threat to validity. This includes issues like missing data, inconsistent data, and inaccurate data.

2.  *Data Privacy*: Privacy concerns can lead to biased data if certain groups opt out of data collection.

3.  *Data Provenance*: The origin and process of data collection can impact its validity. This includes issues like sampling bias and non-response bias.

# Methodological Threats

4.  *Algorithm Bias:* Algorithms used in data analysis can introduce bias, especially in machine learning where the algorithm may "learn" from biased data.

5.  *Multiple Comparisons Problem*: With big data, there's a risk of finding false positives by making many comparisons between variables.

6.  *Overfitting*: In machine learning, models can become too complex and fit too closely to the training data, reducing their ability to generalize to new data.

# Contextual Threats

7.  *Temporal Validity:* The validity of findings may decrease over time, especially in fast-changing fields.

8.  *Ecological Fallacy:* Conclusions about individuals can't always be made based on group-level data.

9.  *Simpson's Paradox:* A trend appearing in different groups of data can disappear or reverse when the groups are combined.
