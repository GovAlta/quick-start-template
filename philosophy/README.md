# ./philosophy/README.md

This folder contains the **project-generic** library of documents describing the foundational philosophy behind the humanâ€“AI collaborative research framework implemented in the project-specific `./ai/` folder. 

This document overviews **FIDES** (Framework for Interpretive Dialogue and Epistemic Symbiosis) - an organizational framework for humanâ€“AI collaboration in research analytics designed to support:

-   Transparent, trustworthy analytic workflows
-   Reflexive and ethical use of AI in research
-   Modal fluency across tables, models, plots, and language
-   Institutional memory and philosophical accountability

| `metaphysics-context-where.md`  | Situates analysis in time, place, and institution |


## ðŸ§­ How to Use This Framework

Think of FIDES as a toolkit of living documentsâ€”each file serves a purpose in helping you communicate the *why*, *what*, *how*, and *for whom* of your research. Start simple: for smaller projects, you might only need the [[mission]] file to capture your main goals. As your work grows more complex, you can add specialized documents to explore different aspects in greater depth.

**Why Two Folders?** We've split things into two main areas: `./philosophy/` contains the big-picture concepts that apply to any research project using AI, while `./ai/` holds the specific details for your current project. Think of it like having a reference library (philosophy) and a project workspace (ai). This way, you can reuse the foundational ideas across different research projects while keeping each project's specific context organized separately.

## ðŸ§  Key Principles

*In no particular order*

1.  **Human-centred, human-flawed.**\
    Interpretations are never neutral; analysis is meaning-making that reflects the mental world of the meaning-maker. That's why ethics, agency, and self-awareness of the human analyst defines the quality of the knowledge that emerges from a research enterprise.

2.  **AI is a translator, not a truth-maker.**\
    It helps move across modes, but it does not hold the frame.

3.  **Humans are accountable.**\
    Only humans decide what matters, what questions to ask, and how results should be used. Human drivers of AI-augmented research systems bear full responsibility for all analytic products co-authored with AI assistants.

4.  **Knowledge is a conversation.**\
    FIDES assists in dialectical movement â€” between modalities, between actors, and over time. To prove a truth, one human must convince another. The role of AI is to assist both humans in this process.

## ðŸ§° Getting Started

1.  Read `teleology-mission-why.md` and `axiology-values-should.md` to understand the purpose.
2.  Explore the data and definitions in `ontology-glossary-what.md`.
3.  Review `epistemology-method-how.md` to understand what counts as valid knowledge.
