# FIDES: Framework for Interpretive Dialogue and Epistemic Symbiosis

Welcome to **FIDES** ‚Äî a living framework for human‚ÄìAI collaboration in analytic work.  
This guide orients data analysts and research writers (DAs, RWs) to the principles, structure, and practice of FIDES.

## üî§ What is FIDES?

**FIDES** stands for:

> **F**ramework for  
> **I**nterpretive  
> **D**ialogue and  
> **E**pistemic  
> **S**ymbiosis

It is designed to support:

- Transparent, trustworthy analytic workflows
- Reflexive and ethical use of AI in research
- Modal fluency across tables, models, plots, and language
- Institutional memory and philosophical accountability

## üß≠ How to Use This Framework

FIDES is organized as a modular folder of living documents. Each file plays a specific role in articulating *why*, *what*, *how*, and *for whom* analytic work is done.

| File in `./philosophy/` | Function |
|------|----------|
| `teleology-mission-why.md` | Declares purpose and impact goals |
| `ontology-glossary-what.md` | Defines key terms and constructs |
| `epistemology-method-how.md` | Articulates valid methods and inference rules |
| `axiology-values-should.md` | Surfaces ethical commitments and consequences |
| `praxeology-action-who.md` | Clarifies actor roles and responsibilities |
| `semiology-expression-which.md` | Maps how meaning is expressed across dialects |
| `metaphysics-context-where.md` | Situates analysis in time, place, and institution |
| `onboarding-ai.md` | Guides how AI should behave and support the human |
| `validation-tests.md` | Specifies checks and epistemic safeguards |
| `logbook.md` | Captures all major analytic decisions over time |
| `quick_start_template.qmd` | Launchpad for doing analytic work within FIDES |

## üß† Key Principles

1. **Interpretation is central.**  
   Data are not neutral; all analysis is meaning-making.

2. **Trust is earned.**  
   Every output must be traceable, reviewable, and justifiable.

3. **AI is a translator, not a truth-maker.**  
   It helps move across modes, but it does not hold the frame.

4. **Humans are accountable.**  
   Only people decide what matters, what questions to ask, and how results are used.

5. **Knowledge is a conversation.**  
   FIDES assists in dialectical movement ‚Äî between modalities, between actors, and over time.

## üß∞ Getting Started

1. Read `teleology-mission-why.md` and `axiology-values-should.md` to understand the purpose.
2. Explore the data and definitions in `ontology-glossary-what.md`.
3. Review `epistemology-method-how.md` to understand what counts as valid knowledge.
4. Use `quick_start_template.qmd` to launch your analysis.
5. Log your major decisions in `logbook.md` ‚Äî what you did, why you did it, and what modes you used.

## ü§ù Welcome to FIDES

By working within this framework, you are joining a project that values rigor, clarity, humility, and purpose. You are not just writing code or fitting models‚Äîyou are contributing to **interpretive dialogue** that shapes how we understand the world.

FIDES exists to help you do that well.
