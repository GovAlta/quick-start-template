# FIDES: Framework for Interpretive Dialogue and Epistemic Symbiosis

Welcome to **FIDES** â€” a organizational framework for humanâ€“AI collaboration in research analytics. This guide familiarizes data analysts (DA) and research writers (RW) with the principles, structure, and practice of FIDES.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¤ What is FIDES?

**FIDES** stands for:

> **F**ramework for\
> **I**nterpretive\
> **D**ialogue and\
> **E**pistemic\
> **S**ymbiosis

It is designed to support:

-   Transparent, trustworthy analytic workflows
-   Reflexive and ethical use of AI in research
-   Modal fluency across tables, models, plots, and language
-   Institutional memory and philosophical accountability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ§­ How to Use This Framework

FIDES is organized as a modular folder of living documents. Each file plays a specific role in articulating *why*, *what*, *how*, and *for whom* analytic work is done. Below is an example of how to modularize communication of human intent and mental context. For smaller projects, documenting intent in the \[\[mission\]\] file may be sufficient. Larger or more complex projects can benefit from additional sub-documents for deeper exploration (not shown here).

| File in `./philosophy/`         | Function                                          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `teleology-mission-why.md`      | Declares purpose and impact goals                 |
| `ontology-glossary-what.md`     | Defines key terms and constructs                  |
| `epistemology-method-how.md`    | Articulates valid methods and inference rules     |
| `axiology-values-should.md`     | Surfaces ethical commitments and consequences     |
| `praxeology-action-who.md`      | Clarifies actor roles and responsibilities        |
| `semiology-expression-which.md` | Maps how meaning is expressed across dialects     |
| `metaphysics-context-where.md`  | Situates analysis in time, place, and institution |

## ðŸ§  Key Principles

*In no particular order*

1.  **Human-centred, human-flawed.**\
    Interpretations are never neutral; analysis is meaning-making that reflects the mental world of the meaning-maker. That's why ethics, agency, and self-awareness of the human analyst defines the quality of the knowledge that emerges from a research enterprise.

2.  **AI is a translator, not a truth-maker.**\
    It helps move across modes, but it does not hold the frame.

3.  **Humans are accountable.**\
    Only humans decide what matters, what questions to ask, and how results should be used. Human drivers of AI-augmented research systems bear full responsibility for all analytic products co-authored with AI assistants.

4.  **Knowledge is a conversation.**\
    FIDES assists in dialectical movement â€” between modalities, between actors, and over time. To prove a truth, one human must convince another. The role of AI is to assist both humans in this process.

## ðŸ§° Getting Started

1.  Read `teleology-mission-why.md` and `axiology-values-should.md` to understand the purpose.
2.  Explore the data and definitions in `ontology-glossary-what.md`.
3.  Review `epistemology-method-how.md` to understand what counts as valid knowledge.
