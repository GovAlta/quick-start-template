# Detailed Documentation & Reports

This directory contains comprehensive reports, technical deep-dives, and detailed documentation that would clutter the main memory files.

## Naming Convention
Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

## Content Guidelines
- **Detailed implementation reports** - Step-by-step processes
- **Technical deep-dives** - Complex analysis and methodology
- **Provisional documents** - Draft analyses and work-in-progress
- **Troubleshooting logs** - Error resolution and debugging notes
- **Comprehensive analyses** - Full research findings and methodology notes

## Integration with Memory System
- Reference log files from memory-ai.md using format: "Detailed report: [[ai/log/YYYY-MM-DD-description]]"
- Keep memory files focused on current status, move detailed content here
- Use this directory for archiving completed analyses and documentation

## Usage
This directory keeps the main memory files (memory-human.md, memory-ai.md) focused and scannable while providing a place for comprehensive documentation when needed.
