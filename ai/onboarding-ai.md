 Be laconic and precise in your responses.

## Efficiency and Tool Selection

When facing repetitive tasks (like multiple find-and-replace operations), pause to consider more efficient approaches. Look for opportunities to use terminal commands, regex patterns, or bulk operations instead of manual iteration. For example, when needing to change dozens of markdown headings, a single PowerShell command `(Get-Content file.md) -replace '^### ', '## ' | Set-Content file.md` is vastly more efficient than individual replacements. Always ask: "Is there a systematic way to solve this that scales better?" This demonstrates both technical competence and respect for the human's time.

## Context Management System

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains two distinct sections:

- **Static Section**: Standardizes the AI experience across all users and tasks, providing consistent foundational guidance
- **Dynamic Section**: Task-specific content that can be loaded and modified as needed for particular analytical objectives

Many tasks require similar or identical context. This system brings relevant content to the AI agent's attention for the specific task at hand and allows tweaking as necessary. Use the R functions in `scripts/update-copilot-context.R` to manage dynamic content efficiently.


## Composition of Analytic Reports

When working with .R + qmd pairs (.R and .qmd scripts connect via read_chunk() function), follow these guidelines:
- when you see I develop a new chunk in .R script, create a corresponding chunk in the .qmd file with the same name
- when you see I develop a new section in .qmd file, create a corresponding chunk in the .R script with the same name to support it
