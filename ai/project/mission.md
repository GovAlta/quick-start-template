# Project Mission (Template)

Provide a clear, concise articulation of the project's purpose, target users, and intended analytical impact.

## Objectives

- Establish a reusable scaffold for data analysis workflows.
- Demonstrate AI-assisted context, persona, and memory integration.
- Support rapid onboarding with minimal friction.
- Maintain separation between portable logic and project-specific storage.

## Success Metrics

- Time-to-first-successful analysis < 30 minutes.
- Persona activation yields relevant guidance without manual edits.
- Memory system captures decisions within normal workflow (<= 3 commands).
- Context refresh operations complete < 2 seconds for core files.

## Non-Goals

- Domain-specific modeling guidance.
- Heavy dependency management beyond base R/Python tooling.
- Automated cloud deployment.

## Stakeholders

- Data analysts: need reproducible templates.
- Research engineers: need portable AI scaffolding.
- Project managers: need visibility into mission/method/glossary.
