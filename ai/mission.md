This files serves as a compass for AI collaborators, articulating the project's purpose, epistemic stance, and analytic goals. It ensures that all AI agents operate within a shared framework of understanding, aligned with the human analyst's intentions.


In a human–AI creative symbiosis, the human serves not merely as an operator, but as a **philosopher–scientist**—the conductor of meaning. Their role is to define the framework within which the AI can execute and translate, but not originate, analytic purpose.



Refer to `./data-private/raw/research_request.md` for the language that humans used to articulate this  research request. Based on this inital request, we articulated the following epistemic aims (i.e. what we want to learn). The language of these aims may evolve as we refine our understanding of the research problem and the data available.


### Epistemic Aims
(what do we want to learn?)

### Technical Aims
(what deliverables do we want to produce?)
