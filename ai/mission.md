# Boilerplate for Human–AI Analytic Projects
# Version 1.1

## CHAPTER 1: PURPOSE
This file defines the foundational logic, constraints, and epistemological commitments of the analytic project.

Epistemic Aim: [Insert e.g., forecast caseload trends, explore latent patterns, etc.]

Dialects in Use:
- Tabular
- Algebraic
- Graphical
- Schematic
- Syntactic
- Numeric
- Semantic

## CHAPTER 2: ONTOLOGICAL AXIOMS
- A1. Time is discrete and unidirectional.
- A2. Each observation is a coherent atomic unit.
- A3. Null = missing, not zero.
- A4. Transformations must be reproducible.
- A5. Aggregations must preserve units.

## CHAPTER 3: EPISTEMOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Permitted Reasoning Methods:
- Descriptive stats
- Bayesian modeling
- DAG-based inference
- Simulation-based estimation

Modal Translation Protocols:
AI or human may request cross-modal expression of results (e.g., diagram ↔ narrative).

## CHAPTER 4: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Human Analyst: defines goals, axioms, interprets meaning.
AI Agent: translates, executes, explains.

## CHAPTER 5: OUTPUT VALIDATION
Checklist:
1. Internal logic
2. Modality alignment
3. Fit to purpose
4. Interpretability
5. Optional external review
