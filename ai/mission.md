Refer to `./data-private/raw/research_request.md` for the language that humans used to articulate this  research request. Based on this inital request, we articulated the following epistemic aims (i.e. what we want to learn). The language of these aims may evolve as we refine our understanding of the research problem and the data available.


### Epistemic Aims

- A. Explore and compare trajectories of Income Support usage between clients approved and denied after completing an Intake and Employment Readiness Assessment (ERA), specifically focusing on Stream B segmented clients.

- B. Quantify and characterize the duration and recurrence patterns of Income Support usage among approved and denied clients

- C. Evaluate the impact of CEIS workshops/job placement interventions on subsequent Income Support usage among initially denied clients

- D. Estimate total Income Support usage over a defined follow-up period (e.g., one year post initial approval/denial)
