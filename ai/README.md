# Creative Symbiosis Analytic Framework

## 🧠 Purpose

This folder provides a minimal, rigorous, and extensible framework for **human–AI collaborative data analysis**, where the human serves as **philosopher–scientist** and the AI functions as a **modal translator and analytic executor**.

It establishes a project foundation rooted in:

- Epistemological clarity
- Reproducible reasoning
- Modal fluency across data expressions (code, graphs, models, narrative)
- Domain-aligned semantics and logic

## 📂 Included Files

| File              | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `./ai/mission.txt`     | Declares axioms, epistemic stance, allowed reasoning methods, and analytic goals |
| `./ai/onboarding_ai.md`| Instructs AI agents how to interpret the project’s logic, ask for clarification, and translate modalities |
| `./ai/glossary.md`     | Defines critical domain terms to prevent semantic drift |
| `./ai/logbook.md`      | Maintains a chronological, epistemic trace of decisions, model changes, and human–AI exchanges |
| `./ai/dialectical_epistemology.md`      | Outlines the philosophical foundation for human–AI analytic collaboration, framing analysis as a movement across epistemic dialects guided by the human as conductor of meaning |

## 🔁 Use Case

Use this framework to launch any project that aims to:
- Maintain high interpretability in AI-assisted analytics
- Avoid black-box decisions and silent assumptions
- Structure team handoffs or long-running analytic workflows
- Build cumulative knowledge over iterative modeling cycles

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Customize `./ai/mission.md` to define your project's purpose, axioms, and logic.
3. Tailor `./ai/glossary.md` to your domain.
4. Begin logging analytic moves in `./ai/logbook.md`.
5. Ensure AI agents are prompted using the `./ai/onboarding_ai.md` structure.
