# ./ai/README.md

This folder contains the **project-specific**  documents that build on the foundational philosophy from the project-generic `./philosophy/` folder to address the needs of this particular human–AI collaborative research project. 

This document overviews the **project-specific implementation** of FIDES (Framework for Interpretive Dialogue and Epistemic Symbiosis) - an extensible framework for the practical components of **human–AI collaborative data analysis**, where the human serves as **philosopher–scientist** and the AI functions as a **modal translator and analytic executor**.

The folder also offers guidance for engaging memory and project management (MPM) system, explains file architecture specific to the project, and other project-specific nuances  instrumental for directing the scope of AI assistance.
