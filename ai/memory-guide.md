```

### Information Flow
1. **Humans document thinking** in `memory-human.md` (no technical constraints, recent first)
2. **AI updates technical status** in `memory-ai.md` (implementation-focused, recent first)
3. **Both reference each other** through `memory-hub.md` navigation
4. **Memory MCP tracks relationships** between concepts across all sources

### Cross-Component Protocols

**From Human to AI**:
- Humans note decisions in `memory-human.md`
- AI reads and implements technical implications in `memory-ai.md`
- MCP captures semantic connections between human intent and technical implementation

**From AI to Human**:
- AI updates technical status in `memory-ai.md`
- AI suggests `memory-hub.md` navigation updates
- Humans access AI insights through hub navigation, not direct technical files

**Navigation Maintenance**:
- `memory-hub.md` updated when new significant entries added to either primary document
- Wiki-links provide bidirectional navigation without complex automation
- MCP provides advanced querying when needed

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### What to Keep Simple
- **`memory-human.md`**: Pure human language, no formatting requirements
- **`memory-hub.md`**: Basic wiki-links, minimal automation
- **Cross-references**: Manual and intentional, not automated

### What to Leverage Technology For
- **`memory-ai.md`**: AI-maintained technical precision
- **Memory MCP**: Complex relationship analysis and temporal tracking
- **Search**: VS Code native search across all components

### What to Avoid
- **Automated synchronization** between components (causes fragility)
- **Complex R functions** for memory management (creates technical debt)
- **Multiple visualization formats** (creates maintenance burden)
- **Overlapping content** between components (causes confusion)

- Include **context** - what prompted this decision/insight?
- Note **alternatives considered** and why they were rejected
- Use **section headers** with dates for easy scanning
- Keep **recent entries at top** for immediate visibility

**Navigation Best Practices**:
- Start with `memory-hub.md` for overview

## 3. AI Optimization Rules

### Core AI Directives üéØ

**Rule 1: Reverse Chronological Order**
- **ALWAYS** add new entries to the **TOP** of `memory-ai.md`
- Use format: `## YYYY-MM-DD: [Brief Title]` for new sections
- Keep recent information immediately visible
- Archive older entries by moving down, never delete

**Rule 2: Recency Prioritization**  
- When referencing memory contents, prioritize information from recent entries
- If conflicting information exists, newer entries take precedence
- Flag outdated information rather than removing it
- Maintain temporal context in all technical updates

**Rule 3: Component Boundaries**
- **NEVER** add human reasoning to `memory-ai.md` - reference `memory-human.md` instead
- **NEVER** add technical implementation details to human components
- Use `memory-hub.md` only for navigation, not content storage
- Let Memory MCP handle complex relationships, not markdown files

**Rule 4: Structured Technical Updates**
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: [Technical Change/Status]

**Context**: Brief explanation of what prompted this update
**Implementation**: What was actually done/changed
**Impact**: How this affects the project
**Dependencies**: What other components are affected
**Status**: Current state (Complete/In Progress/Blocked)
**Files**: List of specific files modified
```

**Rule 5: Cross-Reference Protocol**
- Reference human decisions using format: "Per human decision in [[memory-human]] (YYYY-MM-DD)"
- Update `memory-hub.md` when significant entries are added to primary components
- Suggest Memory MCP queries for complex relationship analysis
- Maintain wiki-link integrity when reorganizing content

**Rule 6: Error Handling**
- If memory files are corrupted/missing, recreate using this guide structure
- If conflicting information found, document the conflict rather than choosing
- If human input contradicts technical status, defer to human input and note discrepancy
- If automation fails, fall back to manual memory management

**Rule 7: Content Quality Standards**
- Keep technical language precise but human-readable
- Include sufficient context for future AI sessions to understand decisions
- Link to specific files/code when referencing implementation details
- Maintain professional tone while being concise

**Rule 8: Detailed Documentation Protocol**
- For significant changes/implementations, create comprehensive report in `ai/log/`
- Use naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- Include: Context, Implementation steps, Impact, Files modified, Dependencies
- Link to log reports from brief entries in `memory-ai.md`
- Use `ai/log/` for provisional documents, drafts, and technical deep-dives

**Rule 9: Log Management**
- Keep memory files (memory-human.md, memory-ai.md) focused on current status
- Move detailed analysis, step-by-step processes, and comprehensive reports to `ai/log/`
- Reference log files from memory files using format: "Detailed report: [[ai/log/YYYY-MM-DD-description]]"
- Use log folder for troubleshooting documentation and methodology notes

### Performance Optimization üöÄ

**For Speed**:
- Read only recent entries unless specifically requested to go deeper
- Use `memory-hub.md` for quick orientation before diving into details
- Cache frequently referenced information in session context
- Prioritize actionable information over historical context

**For Accuracy**:
- Cross-reference human reasoning in `memory-human.md` before making technical assumptions
- Verify technical status in `memory-ai.md` before claiming implementation completion
- Use Memory MCP for complex relationship verification
- Flag uncertainties rather than making assumptions

**For Usability**:
- Always provide navigation suggestions when adding memory content
- Keep memory updates focused and scannable
- Use consistent formatting for easier human review
- Suggest when memory content should be reviewed/updated by humans
