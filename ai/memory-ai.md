# AI Memory - Technical Status & Implementation Notes

*AI-maintained technical status for briefing humans on project state*  
*Recent entries first - scroll down for historical implementation context*

---

## Template Instructions for AI

This memory file is automatically maintained by AI assistants to track:

- **Technical implementation status** across project components
- **Code quality assessments** and areas needing attention  
- **Integration points** between different system components
- **Performance considerations** and optimization opportunities
- **Dependency tracking** and version compatibility notes

### Auto-Update Triggers

The AI system automatically updates this file when:
- New analysis components are created or modified
- Data processing pipelines are established or changed
- Testing frameworks are implemented or updated
- Configuration changes affect system behavior
- Integration with external systems is modified

### Memory Structure

Entries follow this format:
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: Component/System Name

**Status**: [Operational/In Development/Needs Attention]
**Changes**: Brief description of what changed
**Impact**: Effect on other components or workflows
**Next Steps**: Recommended actions or monitoring needed
```
