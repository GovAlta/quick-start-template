This document provides general instructions and guidelines for developing the narrative of the analytic exercises eda-3. 

Let us structure the document as a dialogue between the analyst and the reader. The analyst will pose questions that should focus the attention of the reader on a particular idea and then answer this question with display of quantitative information derived from available data. 

One chunk = one idea = one question = one answer = one visualization or table.
