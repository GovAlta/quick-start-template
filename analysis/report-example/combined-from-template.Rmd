This report demonstrates a simple report created from an `.Rmd` template from `./scripts/templates/combined.Rmd`

```{r, echo=F, message=F, results = 'hide'}
cat("Working directory: ", getwd()) # turn on to test the location
# if the line above generates the project root, re-map by selecting 
# Session --> Set Working Directory --> To Source File location
# alternatively, set wd for knitting environment
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir='../../')  #Don't combine this call with any other chunk -especially one that uses file paths.
```

```{r set_options, echo=F}
# cat("Working directory: ", getwd()) # turn on to test the location
report_render_start_time <- Sys.time()
# set options shared by all chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  results      = 'show',

# What is a row? {#what-is-a-row}

## Q.1 What is the grain of this data set?

> Grain - the most granular level of the data, answers the question "What is a row?"

Each row of `ds0` represents a person

```{r what-is-a-row }
ds0 %>% nrow()
ds0 %>% summarize(row_count=n())
ds0 %>% summarize(
  row_count = n()
  ,id_count = n_distinct(id)
) %>%
  mutate(
    id_is_the_grain = row_count == id_count
  )
```

# Data Description {#data-description}

## Q.2 What is the period of observation?

```{r}
ds0$date %>% summary() # looks like from [2011 to 2014]

ds0 %>% 
  summarize(
    earliest_date  = min(date,na.rm=T)
    ,latest_date   = max(date,na.rm=T)
    ,span_in_days  = (latest_date-earliest_date)
  )
```

# Analysis

## Q.3 What is sex ratio?

### Table 1

```{r table-1, echo = echo_chunks, results='show', message=message_chunks, class.source = "fold-show"}
ds1 %>% group_by(sex) %>% count()
ds1 %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(row_count = n())
ds1 %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(respondent_count = n_distinct(id))

ds1 %>% 
  # mutate(weight = 1L) %>% # to test if weight changes the numbers
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    respondent_count = n()
    ,client_count    = sum(weight) # account for sampling and non-response weight
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    respondent_share = respondent_count/sum(respondent_count)
    ,client_share    = client_count/sum(client_count)
)
```

### Graph 1

We can create a graph on the fly...

```{r graph-1, echo=echo_chunks, fig.height=4, fig.width=9, message=FALSE, class.source='fold-hide', results='show'}
ds1 %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(client_count = sum(weight)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = client_count, x = sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

Alternatively, organizing as sequence of objects (i.e. rectangle `ds1` begets plot `g1`) allows to be more versatile:

```{r graph-2, echo = echo_chunks, results='show', message=message_chunks}
g1 <-
  ds1 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(client_count = sum(weight)) %>%
  ggplot(data=., aes(y = client_count, x = sex)) +
  geom_col()
g1 %>% print()
ggsave("./analysis/report-example/g1.png",plot=g1)
ggsave("./analysis/report-example/g1.png",plot=g1,width=6,height = 4) # optimize
ggsave("./analysis/report-example/g1.jpg",plot=g1,width=21,height = 14,units = "cm") # optimize
```
