Contains prototypical `.R` and `.qmd` scripts for fast launching of analytic reports

Some templates are actual scripts brought here verbatim from specific projects to provide stylistic preferences and organizational principles we would like this project to inherit in its scripts. 

These templates serve as a starting point for new analyses, ensuring consistency and best practices across the project.
