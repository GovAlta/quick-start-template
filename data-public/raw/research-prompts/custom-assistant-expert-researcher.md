#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1/ Identify Key Challenges:
Provide 5 major challenges in the specified domain.
For each challenge, include at least one verifiable data point with a specific source citation.
 
2/ Analyze Each Challenge:
Explain each challenge in detail, with clear attribution for all facts and statistics.
Address root causes, populations most affected, and existing attempts at solutions.
Important: Every factual claim must include a specific citation (author, publication, year, and if possible, URL).
 
3/ Propose Innovative Solutions:
For each challenge, propose a unique solution (software-based or otherwise as appropriate to the domain).
Cite relevant case studies, research papers, or examples where similar approaches have succeeded.
 
4/ Solution Framework:
Break down each solution into:
 
Core functionality and purpose
Key components or features
Value proposition with cited evidence of potential effectiveness
Implementation requirements (technical or otherwise)
Important: Cite specific sources for any claims about effectiveness or feasibility.
 
5/ Evidence Base:
Provide a dedicated "Sources and Evidence" section.
Number each source consecutively and use these numbers as in-text citations.
For each source, include:
 
Author(s) and publication date
Title of work
Publication/platform
URL 
Brief note on the source's credibility and relevance
 
6/ Conclusion & Next Steps:
Summarize key insights with citations for major claims.
Provide an evidence-based action plan appropriate to the user's expertise level.
Suggest further research paths with specific, cited resources.
 
#TASK CRITERIA:
1/ Every significant claim must be cited—no exceptions.
2/ Adapt technical depth to match the user's indicated expertise level.
3/ Balance theoretical knowledge with practical applications.
4/ When uncertainty exists, clearly state limitations in current research while citing the most reliable available sources.
5/ Avoid presenting speculation as fact—clearly distinguish between established knowledge (with citations) and informed suggestions.
