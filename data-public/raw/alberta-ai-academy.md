# I. What Is Alberta AI Academy?
September 2025 was the first open, cross‑ministry Level 1 cohort. It delivered *immersive pattern exposure* rather than passive orientation — two weeks of rapid cycling through applied use cases. This intensity is what builds the internal “pattern library”; sporadic, opportunistic dabbling does not replicate that cognitive shift.

**Level Progression (academy design)**  
- **Level 1:** Foundational usage: prompt structuring, evaluation discipline (RICECO / TRUST), multi‑modal transformation, applied tooling.  
- **Level 2:** Prototype orchestration: agentic workflows (automated task delegation to AI agents), chaining, solution design.  
- **Level 3:** Enterprise integration: production‑ready governed workflows, cross‑department scaling.

**Curriculum Emphasis (observed)**  
- Prompt engineering & structured context design  
- Systematic response evaluation ([RICECO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7YjqKk-7Y0) prompting framework)  
- Reusable prompt architectures ([PromptLab](https://promptlab.ca/) exercises)  
- Deep + wide research acceleration ([Manus](https://manus.ai) + comparative models)  
- Voice‑to‑structured transformation ([Voice Processor](https://voice.albertaaiacademy.com/), [Voice to Vision demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku-BOEP8eAw))  
- Graph / image / video extraction ([Image Processor](https://image.albertaaiacademy.com/), [DistillFrame](https://distillframe.com/))  
- Workflow composition & reproducibility ([LogicStudio](https://logicstudio.aim.int.gov.ab.ca/))  
- Front‑end generative scaffolding (Lovable, Gemini, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co))  
- Secure knowledge mining ([Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKpvBdiEEFI) / SharePoint agents)

Immersion effect: sustained exposure to a wide array of live use cases builds the “pattern library” necessary to spot leverage points inside one’s base role. This learning dynamic is significantly diminished in shallow, sporadic exposure formats.
